# Deployment Guide

## Deploying to Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel offers excellent free hosting for Node.js applications with automatic HTTPS, global CDN, and easy environment variable management.

### Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Git repository with your memorial website code
- All content added (photos, obituary, GoFundMe link)

---

## Step 1: Prepare Your Code

**Verify everything is ready:**
- ✅ Landing page photo at `public/images/landing/photo.jpg`
- ✅ Obituary text updated in `public/index.html`
- ✅ Photos uploaded via admin panel (or in `public/images/gallery/`)
- ✅ GoFundMe link added to `public/flowers.html`
- ✅ `.env.local` file created with your credentials (NOT committed to Git)

---

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

**If you haven't set up Git yet:**
1. Create a new repository on [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Follow GitHub's instructions to push your code

---

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

### Initial Setup

1. **Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)**
2. **Sign up with GitHub** (recommended for easy integration)
3. **Click "Add New..." → "Project"**
4. **Import your GitHub repository:**
   - Select the memorial website repository
   - Click "Import"

### Project Configuration

5. **Configure Build Settings:**
   - **Project Name**: memorial-website (or your choice)
   - **Framework Preset**: Other (Vercel auto-detects Node.js)
   - **Root Directory**: ./ (leave as default)
   - **Build Command**: `npm install` (auto-detected)
   - **Output Directory**: (leave empty)
   - **Install Command**: `npm install` (auto-detected)
   - **Development Command**: (leave empty)

6. **Add Environment Variables** (CRITICAL - Don't skip!):
   - Expand the "Environment Variables" section
   - Add each variable for **Production, Preview, and Development**:

   | Variable | Value | Description |
   |----------|-------|-------------|
   | `ADMIN_USERNAME` | your-username | Your admin panel username |
   | `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | YourSecurePassword123! | Password (plaintext - app hashes it) |
   | `SESSION_SECRET` | long-random-string | Generate at randomkeygen.com |
   | `NODE_ENV` | production | Sets production mode |

   **How to add each variable:**
   - Type variable name in "Key" field
   - Enter value in "Value" field
   - Check all three boxes: Production, Preview, Development
   - Click "Add"

7. **Click "Deploy"**

Vercel will:
- Install dependencies
- Build your project
- Deploy to a global CDN
- Provide a live URL

**Your site will be live at:** `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

---

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

**After deployment completes (2-3 minutes):**

1. Visit your live URL
2. Test all 4 pages (Home, Through the Years, Memories, In Lieu of Flowers)
3. Navigate to `/admin` and log in with your credentials
4. Test uploading a photo
5. Submit a test memory on the Memories page
6. Edit/delete test content via admin panel

---

## Step 5: Custom Domain (Optional)

**Add your own domain:**

1. Buy a domain (Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
2. In Vercel dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Domains
3. Click "Add Domain"
4. Enter your domain name
5. Follow Vercel's instructions to configure DNS

Vercel automatically provides:
- Free SSL certificate
- Automatic HTTPS
- Global CDN

---

## Environment Variables Reference

### Required Variables

```env
ADMIN_USERNAME=your-username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret-key-here
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Important Notes

- **ADMIN_PASSWORD**: Use plaintext - the app automatically hashes it with bcrypt
- **SESSION_SECRET**: Generate at https://randomkeygen.com/ (use "Fort Knox Password")
- **Never commit** `.env` or `.env.local` files to Git (already in `.gitignore`)
- Set these in Vercel dashboard, not in code
- The app shows a warning on startup if using default credentials

### Where to Set in Vercel

**Option 1: During Initial Deployment**
- Add in "Environment Variables" section before clicking "Deploy"

**Option 2: After Deployment**
1. Go to your project in Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Settings"
3. Click "Environment Variables" in sidebar
4. Add/edit variables
5. Redeploy for changes to take effect

---

## Updating Your Site

### Auto-Deploy on Git Push

Vercel automatically redeploys when you push to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update content"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will detect the push and redeploy automatically (takes ~1-2 minutes).

### Manual Redeploy

In Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click "..." on latest deployment → "Redeploy"

---

## Data Persistence

**✅ FULLY PERSISTENT STORAGE**

This application uses **Vercel Postgres** and **Vercel Blob** for complete data persistence:

**Database (Vercel Postgres - Neon):**
- Stores all memories (name, message, photo URLs, timestamps)
- Stores gallery metadata (filename, photo URL, caption, display order)
- Stores admin sessions for authentication across serverless instances
- **Data survives:** Redeployments, serverless scaling, instance restarts

**Photo Storage (Vercel Blob):**
- Stores all gallery photos
- Stores all memory photos
- Photos accessible via secure HTTPS URLs
- **Photos survive:** Redeployments, function scaling, all scenarios

**Session Storage (PostgreSQL):**
- Admin sessions stored in database, not memory
- Ensures login persists across different serverless function instances
- Fixes 401 authentication errors common in serverless environments

**No data loss on:**
- Git push / redeployment
- Vercel function scaling
- Serverless instance changes
- Project updates
- Environment variable changes

**Free Tier Limits:**
- Postgres: 256 MB storage, 60 hours compute/month
- Blob: 500 GB bandwidth/month
- Should be more than sufficient for a memorial website

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Check:**
- All dependencies in `package.json` are correct
- No syntax errors in code
- Build logs in Vercel dashboard for error details

**Solution:**
- Review build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Test `npm install` and `npm start` locally first

### Admin Login Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- "Invalid credentials" error
- Can't access `/admin`

**Solutions:**
1. Verify environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
2. Check that you're using the correct credentials
3. Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` is set
4. Redeploy after adding environment variables
5. Check function logs for "WARNING: Using default admin credentials"

### Memories/Photos Not Saving

**Cause:** Database or Blob storage connection issue

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Vercel Postgres is connected (Storage tab in Vercel dashboard)
2. Verify Vercel Blob is connected (Storage tab in Vercel dashboard)
3. Check environment variables:
   - `POSTGRES_URL` should be auto-configured
   - `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` should be auto-configured
4. Check Vercel function logs for specific errors
5. Test database connection in Storage dashboard
6. Verify free tier limits haven't been exceeded

### Images Not Loading

**Check:**
- Files are committed to Git
- File paths are case-sensitive
- Images exist in `public/images/` directories
- Check browser console for 404 errors

**Solution:**
```bash
git add public/images/
git commit -m "Add images"
git push
```

### Admin 401 Errors / Can't Stay Logged In

**Symptoms:**
- Log in successfully but get 401 errors on admin operations
- Session expires immediately
- Works on one tab but fails on another

**Cause:** Session persistence issue (now fixed with PostgreSQL session store)

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable exists
2. Check that database connection is working
3. Verify session table exists (automatically created)
4. Clear all browser cookies for the site
5. Log in again
6. Check Vercel function logs for session/database errors

**Technical Fix Applied:**
- Sessions now stored in PostgreSQL instead of memory
- Uses `connect-pg-simple` package
- Ensures sessions persist across serverless function instances
- This fix resolves the "works for gallery but not memories" issue

### Function Timeout Errors

**Cause:** Vercel has 10-second function timeout on free tier

**Solution:**
- Reduce image sizes before uploading
- Current implementation should work fine
- If issues persist, consider upgrading Vercel plan

## Why Vercel?

This application is **specifically designed for Vercel** with:
- Vercel Postgres (Neon) for database
- Vercel Blob for photo storage
- PostgreSQL session store for serverless authentication

**Alternative platforms would require:**
- Setting up your own PostgreSQL database
- Setting up your own object storage (S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
- Modifying code to use different storage providers
- Additional configuration and cost

**Recommendation:** Use Vercel for this project. It's free, fast, and designed to work out-of-the-box with this codebase.
