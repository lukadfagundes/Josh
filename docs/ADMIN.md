# Admin Panel Guide

## Accessing the Admin Panel

Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000/admin**

The admin link is not visible on any public pages - you must navigate to it directly.

## Default Login Credentials

**IMPORTANT: Change these before deploying!**

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `changeme123`

## Changing Admin Credentials (Recommended Method)

**Using Environment Variables:**

1. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` file and change the values:
   ```env
   ADMIN_USERNAME=your-username
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
   SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret-key-here
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Restart the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

**Notes:**
- Password is stored as plaintext in `.env` but automatically hashed with bcrypt by the app
- `.env` file is in `.gitignore` so it won't be committed to Git
- Generate a random session secret at: https://randomkeygen.com/
- The app supports both `.env` and `.env.local` (tries `.env.local` first)
- Default credentials will show a warning message on server startup

## Admin Panel Features

### Photo Gallery Management

**Upload Photos with Image Cropping:**

3. Update the caption
4. Click "Save Changes"

**Delete Photo:**
1. Find the photo in the gallery list
2. Click "Delete"
3. Confirm deletion

### Memories Management

**View All Memories:**
- Click "Memories" tab
- All submitted memories are listed with name, message, timestamp, and photo (if attached)

2. Click "Edit"
3. Modify the name or message

- Photos are cropped by visitors when they submit their memory
- You cannot edit or replace photos - visitors handle cropping before submission
- To remove a photo, you must delete the entire memory

**Note:** Memory photos are separate from the "Through the Years" gallery. Visitors crop these photos when submitting memories, ensuring the best presentation.

**Delete Memory:**
1. Find the memory you want to delete
2. Click "Delete"
3. Confirm deletion
4. Both the memory text and any attached photo will be removed

## Security Notes

### Session Security

- Sessions expire after 24 hours
- httpOnly cookies prevent XSS attacks
- In production, cookies use HTTPS only

### File Upload Security

- Only image files allowed (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- 10MB file size limit for all uploads
- Files are validated before upload
- **Gallery photos:** Cropped by admin before upload using Cropper.js in admin panel
- **Memory photos:** Cropped by visitors before submission using Cropper.js on public form
- Uploaded files stored in **Vercel Blob** with unique identifiers
- Automatic cleanup on upload errors or deletions
- All photos accessible via secure Blob URLs
- Photos persist across deployments and serverless scaling

### Rate Limiting

The public memories form has rate limiting (5 submissions per minute per IP).

Admin panel does NOT have rate limiting - only you should have access.

## Important Security Steps Before Deployment

1. **Create .env file** from `.env.example`
2. **Change admin credentials** in `.env`:
   - Set ADMIN_USERNAME to your desired username
   - Set ADMIN_PASSWORD to a strong password (stored as plaintext in .env, hashed by app)
   - Generate SESSION_SECRET at https://randomkeygen.com/
3. **Set NODE_ENV=production** for production deployment
4. **Never commit .env files** - already in `.gitignore`

### Environment Variables (Already Configured)

The application already has environment variable support configured with `dotenv`. The app:
- Tries to load `.env.local` first, then `.env`
- Automatically hashes passwords with bcrypt
- Shows a warning if default credentials are used
- `.env` files are already in `.gitignore`

Required environment variables:
```
ADMIN_USERNAME=your-username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-plaintext-password
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret-key-here
NODE_ENV=development (or production)
```

## Troubleshooting

**Can't log in:**
- Check that environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
- Clear browser cookies and try again
- Check Vercel function logs for errors
- Verify `SESSION_SECRET` is configured

**Session expires immediately / 401 errors:**
- Session data is stored in PostgreSQL for serverless persistence
- Check that `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable is set
- Verify database connection is working
- Clear browser cookies and try logging in again

**Photos not uploading:**
- Check file size (must be under 10MB)
- Verify file is an image (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Ensure `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` environment variable is set
- Check Vercel Blob storage quota (free tier: 500 GB/month bandwidth)
- Check Vercel function logs for specific errors

**Photos not displaying on public page:**
- Verify photos were successfully uploaded to Vercel Blob
- Check that database contains photo URLs
- Check browser console for errors
- Try clearing browser cache
- Verify Blob URLs are accessible

**Cropper not working:**
- **Admin panel:** Ensure Cropper.js is loaded (check browser console)
  - CDN link in admin.html: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/cropperjs/1.6.1/cropper.min.js
- **Memories page:** Ensure Cropper.js is loaded on public page
  - CDN link in memories.html: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/cropperjs/1.6.1/cropper.min.js
- Check that image file is a valid image format

**Memories not updating:**
- Check Vercel function logs for database errors
- Verify `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable is set
- Check PostgreSQL connection in Vercel Storage dashboard
- Test database connectivity

## Backup Recommendations

**Database Backup:**
- Vercel Postgres (Neon) automatically backs up your database
- You can export data from Vercel Storage dashboard
- Navigate to Storage → Your Postgres database → Data tab
- Use SQL queries to export specific tables if needed

**Blob Storage:**
- Photos are stored in Vercel Blob with high redundancy
- You can browse and download photos from Vercel Storage dashboard
- Navigate to Storage → Your Blob store → Browse files

**Manual Backup (Optional):**
- Export database tables as SQL or CSV
- Download photos from Blob storage dashboard
- Store backups locally or in cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)

## Support

If you encounter issues with the admin panel, check the server logs in your terminal for detailed error messages.
