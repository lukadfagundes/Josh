        <p class="mb-2">
          Mental Health is important, and when battling things like Bipolar Disorder, it's important
          to know yourself and how best to navigate the world around you. Josh struggled for his
          entire life, trying to find that delicate balance between mania and depression to feel
          some kind of normalcy with his brain. When things become difficult it's easy to turn to
          things such as alcohol as a way to cope, and it's important to recognize the signs and
          make positive changes in your life. I've left a number of resources available here and
          urge anyone reading this; if you or someone you love is struggling, please, get the help
          that's needed before it's too late.

        <h2>Support the Family</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
          My brothers and I, along with our entire family, want to say a big thank you to the
          American Legion from Post 81 and Post 424, including the Sons of the American Legion &
          American Legion Riders, along with several members who personally donated, for their
          outpourance of support, condolences, and assistance with covering the cost of Josh's
          cremation.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          While the cost of the cremation is covered, in lieu of flowers, we ask for your support
          with our GoFundMe below. Times are tough, and if you are unable to donate, merely sharing
          the link will go a long way in helping us celebrate our brother's life. All funds donated
          will go to the following:
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          - Purchasing additional urns to hold ashes for his children and his fiancé
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          - Assisting with travel expenses and lodging to get Josh's children, fiancé, siblings, and
          extended family together for a celebration of life
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">- Assisting with food costs for the celebration of life</p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          $5,000 is a big ask, but we've got family literally all over the country, siblings alone
          spanning from California to Georgia. Any and all funds not used for the celebration of
          life will be sent to support his children and fiancé.
