            <strong>Joshua Alexander Downs</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="mb-2">10/16/1994 - 12/07/2025</p>

          <p class="mb-2">
            Kicking and screaming, Joshua Alexander Downs was born into this world on October 16th,
            1994, it was a Sunday. And on December 7, 2025, Josh moved on to rage hell and bring his
            boisterous light back to those who left before him. It was a Sunday.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-2">
            Words alone cannot express the life that he brought into this world. With a Charisma
            stat of max 20, he brought light, joy, and laughter to everyone he knew almost
            effortlessly. He cared for those around to his last breath, and that's evident in
            everything he did and the almost blind love he showed to everyone, a trait he got from
            mom. He loved horror movies, not just the good ones and the classics, but the B Rated
            ones that make your brother's roast you incessantly for even suggesting we watch
            “Machete” and have you checking toilets for clowns. Simple Plan and Green Day always
            blasting through his speakers, and boy was quick with the one liners. You get him in the
            kitchen and you know you're in for a great meal. Josh poured himself into everything he
            did, his friends, his family, his cooking, those kids. If we look close enough we can
            see him in everything.
          </p>

          <p>
            Josh is survived by his fiancé, Hannah Sunseri and daughter Elena; Mother of his
            children Jordan Bamburg and their sons Kole and Joey; His dads, Jason Fagundes and David
            Downs Jr.; His grandma, Gloria Fagundes; His uncles; Tony Fagundes, Samuel Robert
            Marlin, and Frank Marlin; his aunts, Wendy Fagundes, Katie Rachal, and John Griffin;
            Numerous cousins, Rylee Cook, Rebecca Baker, Sara Sheppard, and so many more I know I'm
            forgetting right now. His sister, Ariana Fagundes, nephews Aden-Dain, Draven, and Ezra,
            and nieces Azlynn and Sylis-Rain. His brother, Danny Downs; His brother, Luka Fagundes
            and sister-in-law Caitlin; And his brother, Samuel James Marlin, sister-in-law Robyn,
            nieces Skyler and Charlotte, and nephew Oliver.
          </p>

          <p>
            Josh is preceeded in death by his mom, Tina Marie Downs; Sisters, Holly and Tyra;
            Grandparents Laurian Sheppard Marlin McCaustland, Samuel Howard Marlin, Francine Rachal
            Marlin, Terry McKeen, and Frank Fagundes; and countless others I know that I'm
            forgetting right now. Josh was always the best of us keeping up with family.

            loving them. Buildings burn, people die, but real love is forever." Sarah, The Crow

            You died with your boots on and thats the main thing. We'll plant you in the damn
            garden, next to the stupid lion. I love you, Jerk.
